## Animation Implementation

The animation effects in this app are achieved using the CurvedAnimation widget from the Flutter animation library. The CurvedAnimation widget enables smoother and more natural-looking animations by defining a curve that modifies the progress of the animation over time.

In this dice roller app, the CurvedAnimation widget is used to control the animation of the dice roll. When the user taps the dice, the app generates a random dice value and initiates the animation. The curve is applied to make the dice accelerate and decelerate smoothly during the roll, simulating the physics of a real-world dice roll.
